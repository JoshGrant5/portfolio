      <p id='summary'>I am a full stack developer who relishes the opportunity to use my creativity and intuition to build meaningful things. My degree in criminology cultivated a critical thinking mindset which I bring with me to each problem I tackle. I am diligent in my pursuit of a solution, and my professional background in sales and customer service instilled in me the values of communication and collaboration. When I'm not programming, I can be found listening to podcasts, enjoying local theatre productions, or helping my beer league softball team to victory.</p>
